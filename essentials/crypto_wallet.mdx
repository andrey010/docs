## Crypto Basics for New Users

If you're new to crypto, don’t worry — this short guide will help you understand the essentials before using a wallet or making your first transaction.

## What Is a Crypto Wallet?

A crypto wallet is an app that lets you store and manage your digital assets (like ETH, USDC, BTC, etc.).
It works similarly to an online banking app — but you control everything yourself.

There are two main types of wallets:

### 1. Custodial Wallet

- A company (exchange, bank, app) controls your funds for you

- They hold your private keys

- Easy to use but less control

Examples: Binance, Coinbase, Crypto.com

### 2. Non-Custodial Wallet (Self-Custody)

- You fully control your funds

- Only you have access to your private keys & recovery phrase

- No company can freeze or take your funds

- Requires more responsibility

Examples: MetaMask, Rabby, Trust Wallet, Coinbase Wallet
<Warning>
For our payment system, we recommend a non-custodial wallet, because it ensures your payments go directly from you to the receiver — without middlemen.
</Warning>

## What Are “Non-Custodial Payments”?

Non-custodial payments mean:

- No centralized company holds your money

- Payments happen directly on the blockchain

- You stay in full control of your funds

- The system cannot charge your wallet automatically

- Every transaction requires your approval in the wallet

- This makes payments safer and more transparent.

## Important Security Tips

Because crypto wallets are fully controlled by you, you must follow security best practices:

### 1. Never share your Recovery Phrase (Seed Phrase)

This is the most important rule.
<Warning>
If someone gets your recovery phrase, they can access your wallet and take all your funds.
Even support teams, bots, administrators — nobody should ask for it.
</Warning>

### 2. Keep your wallet app updated

New updates fix security vulnerabilities.
Always update MetaMask, Rabby, or Trust Wallet when possible.

### 3. Double-check every transaction

Before confirming:

- Verify the network (ETH, Base, Arbitrum, etc.)

- Verify the token (ETH, USDC, etc.)

- Verify the amount

- Check that the website you're using is official

### 4. Protect your device

- Use a phone lock or password

- Enable two-factor authentication where possible

- Don’t download unknown apps or files

- Avoid connecting your wallet on suspicious websites

### 5. Never send crypto to someone you don’t trust

Blockchain transactions cannot be reversed.

##  Final Notes

Crypto may seem complicated at first, but once you understand the basics, it's a powerful tool:

- You control your money

- No banks

- No middlemen

- Instant global payments

- Full transparency

If you ever feel unsure, ask questions — it's better to learn slowly than make a risky mistake.
